# Title
Modeling Volatility Clustering and Forecasting Risk in UK Equity Markets Using GARCH and Value-at-Risk
📘 1. Business Problem

Financial institutions must estimate potential daily losses under normal and stressed market conditions.
One common regulatory measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR).

However, financial returns exhibit:

Volatility clustering

Fat tails

Time-varying variance

Therefore, we model conditional volatility using GARCH(1,1) and compare different VaR methods.
